The results of the research allow to find out which method of signal formation gives a lower BER with equal distortion of audio containers. 
The results provide recommendations for the formation of spread sequences for reliable and secure hiding of information messages in the audio file. 
The results demonstrate that different signaling methods give different estimates of BER, MSE, SNR and PSNR. 
This is an area for a possible direction of development, because the choice of how to form spread sequences is very important for various computer programs.
